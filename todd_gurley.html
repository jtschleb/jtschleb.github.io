        <h3>Case for MVP:</h3>
        <p>After a dissapointing sophomore campaign under the Mike Fisher regime that saw him post a sub 1000 season and a league low yards per carry mark, Todd Gurley had a renaissance year in 2017. Under hotshot head coach Sean McVay, Gurley became the engine powering the leagues highest scoring offense. With over 2000 yards from scrimmage and 19 touchdowns in 15 games, Gurley put those horse legs to use, cutting through the line like a Lord of the Rings battle scene, or hurdling defenders like the inanimate showjumping obstacles they are. A fantasy god, Gurley finished the top of fantasy points, which was to be expected considering the frequent 30+ point weeks he had, causing complete havoc in most fantasy leagues. Besides demonstrating own personal abilities, Gurley's turnaround really highlighted the importance of coaching in the NFL, which in turn begs the question, how did Mike Fisher ever recieve money to do it?</p><p> While this may seem to detract from Gurley's overall claim to the MVP trophy, I think it may enhance it. Without the physical attributes this centaur of a man brought to the field every Sunday, McVays game plan would have been limited in a spectacular fashion. While playcalling is of course a factor, Gurley was always the central piece of either the direction or misdirection on the field, both running and catching out of the backfield. Both McVay and QB Goff even agreed, stating their support for the young running back to be the first non-QB to take home the hardware since Adrian Peterson's victory in 2012. Even if Gurley does not claim the MVP trophy this year, I think we can safely assume this former Offensive Rookie of the Year will be adding the big boy version of the Offensive honors to his trophy case February 3rd</p>
