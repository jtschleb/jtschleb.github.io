        <h3>Case for MVP:</h3>
        <p>Long hailed as the GOAT for his ever growing list of accomplishments, Tom Br</p><p> While this may seem to detract from Gurley's overall claim to the MVP trophy, I think it may enhance it. Without the physical attributes this centaur of a man brought to the field every Sunday, McVays game plan would have been limited in a spectacular fashion. While playcalling is of course a factor, Gurley was always the central piece of either the direction or misdirection on the field, both running and catching out of the backfield. Both McVay and QB Goff even agreed, stating their support for the young running back to be the first non-QB to take home the hardware since Adrian Peterson's victory in 2012. Even if Gurley does not claim the MVP trophy this year, I think we can safely assume this former Offensive Rookie of the Year will be adding the big boy version of the Offensive honors to his trophy case February 3rd</p>
