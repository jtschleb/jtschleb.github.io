        <h3>Case for MVP:</h3>
        <p>Hailed by some as the GOAT for his ever growing list of accomplishments, Tom Brady, the human embodiment of the word 'tantrum', has once again tossed his hat into the MVP race. Don't be fooled by the seemingly massive statlines, as this snake's on field success has generally come as a result of masterful scheming by his overlord, Bellichick, and the all star cast of head coaching material he has calling the plays. With nearly all of his postseason success just so "happening" to coincide with a top 5 defense, and an incredible supporting cast that includes the biggest freak to walk the planet in Gronk, this man is nothing more than a cog in possibly the greatest coach ever's ever turning machine. Known lately from his part in a scheme to deflate footballs to give an advantage, as well as for bringing around a personal witch doctor who claims to be able to cure everything from twisted ankles to cancer with the power of elastic bands, organic juice cleanses, and a positive attitude. Rumors of struggle for credit in Foxborough have been circulating as of late, and we can all only pray for the departure of Bellichick to show the world what was really going on south of Boston</p><p>Lately, due to his team's unmatched post-season success, there have been comparisons to Michael Jordan as the greatest athlete ever, despite the fact that his running style resembles a soccer dad bringing out water at halftime, while MJ could dunk over a car. By most traditional definitions, an athlete would be able to excel acros multiple sports, like Bo Jackson or Antonio Gates, whereas the only other sport Tom Brady might be able to enter his name into the ring would likely be a round of darts at a cocktail party, wherein he would inevitably create rule changes to suit his playstyle, or begin publicly screaming at his teammate if things didn't go his way. In any case, should this rat take home the hardware, I think we can all agree it the massive asterisk beside it will point to the team his coach assembled and trained to elevate his play, as well as the cast of 3 head coaches playcalling on the sidelines.</p>
