        <h3>Case for MVP:</h3>
        <p>After a red hot start to his rookie season in 2016, Wentz experienced the growing pains typical of a new signal caller in the NFL. Questions circled as to how he would adjust in his second year, and whether the former division II college player had what it took to cut it at the next level. Wentz silenced all of his critics with what was possibly the most impressive sophomore campaign since Dan Marino's in 1984. Leading what was at the time the highest powered offense in football, over the course of 13 weeks, he racked up 3296 passing yards, with 33 passing TDs to only 7 INTs, while also rushing for another 299 yards on the ground.  </p><p>An unfortunate knee injury late in the game against the Rams saw Wentz tear his right ACL, cutting short his spectacular 2nd season, an issue that may hinder his chances for claiming the top prize at the NFL Awards. While many will be quick to point out how well his team has done in his absence, making it to Super Bowl LII with backup Nick Foles at the helm, both statistical anaylsis and the eye test of the two teams reveals the calibre of Wentz' ability. The Eagles offense dropped off by roughly 150 yards of production and 7 points per game with Wentz sidelined, and had he been at the helm, would likely be favorites to win the Super Bowl this year. Regardless, we cannot look at what ifs, and simply the unbelievable 13 game stretch Wentz put together to make his case for the MVP Award, in a campaign that saw him lead the league in Touchdowns, despite missing 3 games.</p>
