        <h1>The 2017-18 NFL MVP Race</h1>
        <img id="main_img" src="images/all_mvps.jpg" alt="ALL MVPs">
        <p>What a year it has been! With the regular season wrapped up and the playoffs, we are urgently waiting to see who will be competing for the Super Bowl on February 4th. In a year filled with so many incredible performances, we also have to ask the question, which of them stood head and shoulders above the rest and is worthy of being crowned the 2017-18 NFL MVP?  </p>
        <p>While there were plenty of honorable mentions and players who were without a doubt of importance to their team, it's safe to say the race really came down to 2 players who truly were the heart of their teams, and 1 that simply seems that way as a result of good coaching, but fools writers to be in the race. They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="carson_wentz.html">Carson Wentz</a></li>
            <li><a href="todd_gurley.html">Todd Gurley</a></li>
            <li><a href="tom_brady.html">Tom Brady</a></li>
        </ul>
